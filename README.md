# Recommender-Systems

This repository accompanies my YouTube series on **Recommender Systems**, covering concepts and hands-on implementations in Python.

**YouTube Playlist:** [Recommender Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZsOBAyNTZwaeoQXRbx3fIN6-eCcatT3p)

The goal of the series is to build intuition first, then implement real systems step-by-step.

## What This Series Covers

### 1. Introduction to Recommender Systems
Conceptual foundations, types of recommenders, ranking vs prediction, and why recommender systems matter.  
*Slides only – watch on YouTube.*

### 2. Recommender Systems Beyond Netflix
Applications in domains like drug discovery, finance, science, and real-world decision systems.  
*Slides only – watch on YouTube.*

### 3. Evaluation Metrics – NDCG and Ranking
Understanding ranking-based evaluation, especially **NDCG**, with full Python implementation.

### 4. Understanding the Instacart Dataset
Exploratory analysis and preparing real-world data for recommendation tasks.

### 5. Collaborative Filtering – ALS
Matrix factorization using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** and understanding latent factors.

### 6. Neural Collaborative Filtering (Two-Tower Models)
Building modern neural recommender systems using dual-encoder architectures.

### 7. Diversity and Fairness in Recommender Systems
Moving beyond accuracy to consider exposure, bias, and re-ranking strategies.

## Philosophy

Recommender systems are not just machine learning models — they are **ranking systems embedded in products and decision pipelines**.

This repository focuses on:  
- Clear intuition  
- Practical Python implementations  
- Understanding trade-offs  
- Thinking beyond accuracy
